    <string name="page_3_story">Feel free to skip this if your not interested in reading about how I made my AI.\n\n
                                I started with my AI in the RLGym discord server, Here I found a great community centered around creating Rocket league AI\'s.\n\n
                                I started learning the library of Rocket league Gym, This library used the format laid out by Open AI\'s Gym layout. \n\n
                                After looking around for a while I decided to make the AI restricted in the fact that it could on drive Forwards, Backwards, Right, and Left.\n\n
                                This allowed the AI to learn faster because it did not need to learn as many things about the game.\n\n
                                Then I created my own evolution algorithm, This algorithm would create 50 AI\'s in a batch, out of this batch it would pick the best 5, Those 5 would be used to create 40 AI\'s of the next batch, the rest of the 10 would be random allowing for a random chance of finding a different species.\n\n
                                This evolution algorithm was created based on my knowledge of NEAT with me filling in the gaps for anything I did not know.</string>
